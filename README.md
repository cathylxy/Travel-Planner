# Travel Planner


## Proposal

**Travel Planner** is an application that intends to help people plan their trip by adding activities, setting location and 
amount of time they want to spend on each activity. This application also allows people to keep track and 
make change of their plan during their trip. 
For people who want to well plan their trip can use this application as a tool to achieve their goals.

I like making plan especially for things with lots of uncertainty. Travelling is one of the things. 
I would encounter many problems if I did not make a plan. Therefore, I am very interested in designing an app that 
improve peopleâ€™s travel experience by helping them make a travel plan.
